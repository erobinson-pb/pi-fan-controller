# Pi Fan Controller

Raspberry Pi fan controller.

## Description

This repository is a modified fork of the howchoo repository and provides scripts that can be run on the Raspberry Pi that will
monitor the core temperature and start the fan when the temperature reaches a certain threshold.

To use this code, you'll have to install a fan including a 2N2222 transistor to control the fan. The full instructions can be
found in howchoo's guide: [Control Your Raspberry Pi Fan (and Temperature) with Python](https://howchoo.com/g/ote2mjkzzta/control-raspberry-pi-fan-temperature-python).
